# Jump Game Project
## Overview
This project is a simple game developed using the Phaser game framework. The game simulates a character's journey across a series of platforms, where each platform represents a number of maximum jumps the character can make. The objective is to find the minimum number of moves needed to reach the last platform and display the jumps taken at each step.

## Features
**Randomized Platforms**: Each platform has a randomly generated maximum jump value.
**Character Movement**: The character moves automatically and jumps according to the solution provided.
**Game States**: Different states for initializing, preloading assets, and running the game.
**Real-time Physics**: Utilizes Phaser's physics system for collision detection and gravity.
**User Interaction**: Buttons to generate a new problem and solve the current problem.
